// The original display_tools.m file is a MATLAB Class that includes several methods for visualizing results: view_lens, spot_diagram, transmission_plane, line_spread_function, point_spread_function, and MTF.
//
// There are several (kind of equivalent) libraries available, such as matplotlibcpp, which is a C++ wrapper for matplotlib. However, this library and other similar ones may not fully support 3D plots and may not have the same functionality as Matlab's plotting functions. Therefore, a full translation of these functions from Matlab to C++ could be quite complex and beyond the scope of this assistant.
//
// Moreover, the graphical capabilities of C++ are very different from those of MATLAB. 
//
// For visualization functions in C++, you can choose a suitable graphics library based on your requirements, such as SFML, SDL, OpenGL, or DirectX for more complex 3D graphics. 
// For data visualization, libraries like matplotlibcpp or gnuplot-cpp could be suitable, but they may not support all features of MATLAB plotting functions.

// The above frame of code, we need to define or replace the Lens, Data, TransPlaneData, LSFData, and PSFData types according to the actual C++ program structure.
// We will need to fill in the respective methods with code to visualize our data, using the applicable chosen C++ graphics or plotting library.
